    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) is defined as change in global-mean near-surface air temperature (GMST) change due to an instantaneous doubling of CO$_2$ concentrations and once the coupled ocean-atmosphere-sea ice system has acheived a statistical equilibrium (i.e. at the top-of-atmosphere, incoming solar shortwave radiation is balanced by reflected solar shortwave and outgoing thermal longwave radiation).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the “[Gregory method]( https://doi.org/10.1029/2003GL018747)” to approximate the ECS of CMIP6 models based on the first 150 years after an abrupt doubling of CO$_2$\n",
    "concentrations. The Gregory method extrapolates the quasi-linear relationship between GMST and radiative imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere to estimate how much warming would occur if the system were in radiative balance at the top-of-atmosphere, which is by definition the equilibrium response. In particular, we extrapolate the linear relationship that occurs between 100 and 150 years after the abrupt quadrupling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the radiative forcing due to CO$_2$ is a logarithmic function of the CO$_2$ concentration, the GMST change from a first doubling is roughly the same as for a second doubling (to first order, we can assume feedbacks as constant), which means that the GMST change due to a quadrupling of CO$_2$ is roughly $\\Delta T_{4\\times\\mathrm{CO}_2}=2\\times\\mathrm{ECS}$. See also [Mauritsen et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018MS001400) for a detailed application of the Gregory method (with modifications) for the case of one specific CMIP6 model, the MPI-M Earth System Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For another take on applying the Gregory method to estimate ECS, see [Angeline Pendergrass’ code](https://github.com/apendergrass/cmip6-ecs)."
